# Testing

## HTML

This [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) was used to check the following pages of the website:
- Homepage
- Game pages
- Post pages
- Login
- Register

Pages that require the user to be logged in such as the logout page can unfortunately not be check with this tool. 

All warnings came from missing opening and closing tags and were resolved. The following warning was left

![htmlvalidatorwarning](media/readme/htmlvalidator.JPG)

This arrises from using Font Awesome within an element and nothing else and so can safely be left.

## CSS

This [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) was used to check the CSS of the website via manual upload of the CSS file. No errors were found

## Python

The [Code Institute Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to manually input each python file.

All errors except 1 type were removed. These errors were in the form "Class 'Classname' has no 'objects' member". These have been left as it is due to pylint not being capable of picking up the inheritance of objects in models.

## User Story Testing

User story testing was completed on the following completed user stories:

* As an unregistered user I can view each post on the website so that I can select one to read and decide whether to sign up
